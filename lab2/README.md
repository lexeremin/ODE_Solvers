Task:
Body this mass m drops verticaly down from some height. Force of viscous friction affects the body as F_fr=av,
where a>0 - friction coeff. Define how speed of this body depends on time v(t), using Euler method and Rungeâ€“Kutta method of 4th order as C++ methods and part of ODE class.

C++ methods should be precompiled and realization should be future proof for scalability
